# Using Docker and Containers

## Look at some of the Docker for Windows settings
1. On the Windows tray right click on the `Docker Whale` and bring up `Settings`
1. Look at `Shared Drives`
1. Look at the `Advanced Settings`

## Add Docker Support to Project
1. Open WebApi project we have been working with if it is not already open
1. Right click on the WebApi project in `Solution Explorer' and choose `Add/Docker` Support targeting Linux
1. Open the Dockerfile added to the project and change the exposed port to 8081
1. Open the docker-compose.yml file added to the project and map port 37225 to 8081
	```
	version: '3'

	services:
		workshop:
		image: workshop
		ports: 
		- "37225:8081"
		build:
			context: ./Workshop
			dockerfile: Dockerfile
	```
1. Bring up the docker-compose project properties and change {ServicePort} to 37225

## Run the project 
1. Pin the `Output Window` so it stays visible to see the docker commands being run
1. Ensure `docker-compose` is the startup project
1. `Start Debugging` and watch the docker output in the `Ouput Window`
1. When the browser launches with Swagger, try the `Get api\Products` operation in `Swagger`

## Use Docker commands from the command line
1. Open a `command prompt`
1. Check out the images by running `docker images`
1. Checkout the running Docker container by running `docker ps`

## Debugging application running in Docker
1. With the application still running set a `breakpoint` on the first line of the `Get(int id)` method in ProductsController.cs 
1. In the `Swagger Ui` try the `Get /api/Products/{id}` method
1. At the breakpoint step over the first line and poke around with the usual debug helpers like hovering
1. Stop debugging
1. Bring up the DbInitializer.cs file and add a new Product to the Product array
	
	```cs
        var products = new Product[]
        {
        new Product{ Name = "Widget 1.0" },
        new Product{ Name = "Super Widget" },
        new Product{ Name = "Widget Mini" },
        new Product{ Name = "Widget Xtreme" },
        new Product{ Name = "Jumbo Widget" },
        new Product{ Name = "Widget 2.0" },
		new Product{ Name = "A new product" }
        };
	```

1. `Start Debugging` again
1. In the `Swagger UI` try the `Get /api/Products/{id}` using the id of 7
1. Continue at the breakpoint hit

## Look at images and running containers again
1. Go back to the command prompt
1. Check out the images by running `docker images` and notice the time stamp has not changed
1. Checkout the running Docker container by running `docker ps` and notice the time stamp has not changed

## Extras
1. Create an ASPNet WebForms application in a Windows container
