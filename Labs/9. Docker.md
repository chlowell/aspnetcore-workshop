# Using Docker and Containers

## Look at some of the Docker for Windows settings
1. On the Windows tray right click on the `Docker Whale` and bring up `Settings`
1. Look at `Shared Drives` and ensure the drive the project is on is shared.
1. Look at the `Advanced Settings`

## Add Docker Support to Project
1. Open WebApi project we have been working with if it is not already open
1. Right click on the WebApi project in `Solution Explorer` and choose `Add/Docker` Support targeting Linux
1. Open the docker-compose.override.yml file change the ports 80 to 8081

## Debug the project 
1. Pin the `Output Window` so it stays visible to see the docker commands being run
1. Ensure `docker-compose` is the startup project
1. Add a breakpoint to the DbInitializer.Initialize(context); line in the Program.cs file
1. `Start Debugging` and watch the docker output in the `Ouput Window`
1. When the breakpoint is hit, step to cause the exception and examine the exception
1. Stop debugging

## Use Docker commands from the command line
1. Open a `command prompt`
1. Check out the images by running `docker images`
1. Checkout the running Docker container by running `docker ps`

## Fix the LocalDB exception and run the project
As we saw from our exception, our sample app is using a LocalDB SQL database which 
won't work in a Linux container. If we had another SQL database that should be used 
(either in a container, in the cloud, or somewhere else), we could just update the 
connection string setting (via environment variables) in a docker-compose file or in
our Docker hosting environment.

For this sample, though (since we don't have an external SQL Server instance 
available), let's just switch to use a SQLite provider (which will use a 
file-backed database and work in a container for demo purposes).

* **Note** SQLite is not a good choice for containerized usage in most 
scenarios since it makes the container stateful. We're using it here just 
as an expedient way to show off Docker containers without going through the 
steps of setting up an external data store.

1. Remove (or comment out) the line of `Startup.ConfigureServices` that 
registers our `StoreContext` with the 
1. Register `StoreContext` with a call to `services.AddDbContext` using 
`UseSqlite` on the `DbContextOptionsBuilder`.
	```CSharp
	var dbPath = Path.Combine(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(), "StoreDatabase.db");
	services.AddDbContext<StoreContext>(options => options.UseSqlite($"Data Source={dbPath};"));
	```
1. Debug the project again
1. Debug->continue when the breakpoint is hit
1. Get the products from the SwaggerUI
1. Stop debugging

## Look at images and running containers again
1. Go back to the command prompt
1. Check out the images by running `docker images` and notice the time stamp has not changed
1. Checkout the running Docker container by running `docker ps` and notice the time stamp has not changed

## Extras
1. Create an ASPNet WebForms application in a Windows container
