# Adding Entity Framework Core Support to a Web API

## Adding Entity Framework Dependencies

1. Start with the application created in Lab 8
1. Runtime Entity Framework Core packages (`Microsoft.EntityFramework.*`) are 
already included in your project thanks to the 
[`Microsoft.AspNetCore.All`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/metapackage) 
metapackage dependency
1. Make Entity Framework Core commands available to the .NET CLI by adding 
the following `ItemGroup` item to you .csproj:
    ```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <DotNetCliToolReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet" Version="2.0.0" />
    </ItemGroup>
    ```
1. Open a command prompt and (from the directory your csproj is in) run:
`dotnet ef` to get an overview of the EF command line tools available

## Setup the Entity Framework Model

Entity Framework models can be either [code-first](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/aspnetcore/new-db) 
or [database-first](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/aspnetcore/existing-db). 
For now, we will create the model in code first.

1. Create a new class called `Order` in the *Models* folder:
    ```CSharp
    public class Order
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Description { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Product> Products { get; set; }
        public DateTime DateCreated { get; set; }
        public bool Completed { get; set; }
    }
    ```
1. Many-to-many relationships need to be modeled with an explicit join table 
in Entity Framework Core (making that scenario simpler is on 
[the backlog](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/issues/1368)). In 
many cases, though, what appear to be many-to-many relationships really have 
an intermediate entity that's useful to model. In this case, rather than 
linking orders directly to products, it's useful to have an OrderLineItem that 
can contain product and order information as well as data like the quantity 
ordered. Create a class called `OrderLineItem` in the *Models* folder.
    ```CSharp
    public class OrderLineItem
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        [Range(1, 100)] public int Quantity { get; set; }
        public Order Order { get; set; }
        public Product Product { get; set; }
    }
    ```
1. Update the `Order` class you just created to have an `ICollection` of 
`OrderLineItem`s instead of an `ICollection<Product>`. The `Products` 
property can be repurposed to retrieve `Products` from `OrderItems`. The 
`Products` property should also be attributed `[NotMapped]` since it's not 
part of the entity in the database.
    ```CSharp
    public ICollection<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; } = new HashSet<OrderItem>();

    [NotMapped]
    public IEnumerable<Product> Products => OrderItems.Select(o => o.Product);
    ```
1. Update the `Product` class (created in lab 8) to have (a `[NotMapped]`) Orders property and an `IEnumerable<OrderItem>` that returns orders from 
`OrderItems`
    ```CSharp
    public ICollection<OrderItem> OrderItems { get; set; } = new HashSet<OrderItem>();

    [NotMapped]
    public IEnumerable<Order> Orders => OrderItems.Select(o => o.Order);    
    ```
1. Create a DbContext class (`StoreContext`) in a new folder called *Data* 
to serve as the 'connection' class that Entity Framework Core uses to map 
database tables to .NET classes:
    ```CSharp
    public class StoreContext : DbContext
    {
        public StoreContext(DbContextOptions<StoreContext> options)
            : base(options)
        { }

        public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }
        public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
        public DbSet<OrderLineItem> OrderLineItems { get; set; }

        // This method can be used to customize ORM beahviors
        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            // For example, table names for .NET classes can be customized
            modelBuilder.Entity<Order>().ToTable("Order");
            modelBuilder.Entity<Product>().ToTable("Product");
            modelBuilder.Entity<OrderLineItem>().ToTable("OrderLineItem");

            // Or, relationships between entities could be explicitly defined
            // or keys could be defined, etc.
        }
    }
    ```
1. Make the DbContext (`StoreContext`) available to your app by registering 
it in the dependency injection container (by adding the following code to 
`ConfigureServices` in *Startup.cs*)
    ```CSharp
    services.AddDbContext<StoreContext>(contextOptions =>
        contextOptions.UseInMemoryDatabase("sampleStoreDb"));
    ```

## Seed the Database
At this point, necessary infrastructure is in place to read and write entity 
data from a database. We don't have anything in the database, though, so 
let's create a seed method that will populate the database with test data 
if it doesn't exist yet.

1. Create a new static `DbInitializer` class in a new file in the *Data* 
folder
1. In that class, create a static method called `Initialize` to create 
the app's database (if it doesn't exist) and to populate it with initial 
data (if it's empty).
    ```CSharp
    public static void Initialize(StoreContext context)
    {
        // Creates the database if it doesn't exist
        context.Database.EnsureCreated();

        // Checks to see if any products exist
        if (context.Products.Any())
        {
            return;   // DB already has been seeded
        }

        // Initial products
        var products = new Product[]
        {
            new Product{ Name = "Widget 1.0" },
            new Product{ Name = "Super Widget" },
            new Product{ Name = "Widget Mini" },
            new Product{ Name = "Widget Xtreme" },
            new Product{ Name = "Jumbo Widget" },
            new Product{ Name = "Widget 2.0" }
        };

        context.Products.AddRange(products);
        context.SaveChanges();

        // Initial orders
        var orders = new Order[]
        {
            new Order{ Description = "First order", DateCreated = DateTime.Now.AddDays(-10), Completed = true },
            new Order{ Description = "Second order", DateCreated = DateTime.Now }
        };

        context.Orders.AddRange(orders);
        context.SaveChanges();

        // Initial OrderLinesItems
        var orderItems = new OrderLineItem[]
        {
            new OrderLineItem{ Order = orders[0], Product = products[0]},
            new OrderLineItem{ Order = orders[0], Product = products[3]},

            new OrderLineItem{ Order = orders[1], Product = products[1]},
            new OrderLineItem{ Order = orders[1], Product = products[3]},
            new OrderLineItem{ Order = orders[1], Product = products[5]},
        };

        context.OrderLineItems.AddRange(orderItems);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
    ```
1. Update `Main` in *Program.cs* to invoke the `DbInitializer`
    ```CSharp
    var host = BuildWebHost(args);

    using (var scope = host.Services.CreateScope())
    {
        var services = scope.ServiceProvider;
        try
        {
            var context = services.GetRequiredService<StoreContext>();
            DbInitializer.Initialize(context);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            var logger = services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
            logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred while seeding the database.");
        }
    }

    host.Run();
    ```

## Update the App to use the DbContext
Now that an Entity Framework context and models have been created, the 
Products controller from the previous lab can be updated to use them.

1. Add a constructor to `ProductsController` taking a `StoreContext` as 
a parameter (which will be provided via dependency injection at runtime) and 
store the `StoreContext` in a field

    ```CSharp
    private StoreContext _dataContext;

    public ProductsController(StoreContext context)
    {
        _dataContext = context;
    }
    ```
1. Remove the `_products` field (since hard-coded product data is no longer 
needed)
1. Update the `Get()` method to return products from the `StoreContext`. Note 
that there are async versions of most Entity Framework Core APIs that allow 
the action method to become async
    ```CSharp
    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Product>> Get() => 
        await _dataContext.Products.ToListAsync();
    ```
1. Make a similar change to the `Get(int id)` method to use products from the 
`StoreContext` instead of from hard-coded orders.
    ```CSharp
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Get(int id)
    {
        var product = await _dataContext.Products.SingleOrDefaultAsync(p => p.Id == id);
        if (product == null)
        {
            return NotFound();
        }
        return Ok(product);
    }
    ```
1. Finally, update the `Post` method, making sure to add a call to 
`_dataContext.
    ```CSharp
    [HttpPost]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Post([FromBody] Product product)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
        }

        _dataContext.Products.Add(product);
        await _dataContext.SaveChangesAsync();
        return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Get), new { id = product.Id }, product);
    }
    ```

## Scaffold more Controllers
Entity Framework Core tooling can also make it easy to scaffold additional 
controllers for EF entities.

1. Right click the *Controllers* folder in solution explorer and select Add -> 
Controller
1. Select 'Minimal Dependencies' (since this web API doesn't include views) 
and click 'Add'
1. Delete *ScaffoldingReadMe.txt*
1. Right click on *Controllers* again, selecting Add -> Controller
1. Choose 'API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework'
1. Select 'Order' as the model class and 'StoreContext' as the data context 
class
1. Click 'Add' and notice, the new controller added to your project!
1. Repeat these steps to add an `OrderLineItem` controller

## Database migrations
So far, we've been working with an in-memory database, but it's simple to use 
other database providers (like SQL Server, SQLite, MySql, or others).

1. Update the `services.AddDbContext` call in `Startup.ConfigureServices` use 
a SLQ Server database instead of an in-memory database. 
    ```CSharp
    services.AddDbContext<StoreContext>(contextOptions =>
        contextOptions.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));
    ```
1. Add default connection string information to *appsettings.json* to connect to a SQL Server LocalDB database
    ```json
    {
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=OrdersSample;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
1. At this point, we could start the app to create the database, but let's create it with DB migration tools to demonstrate how those work. From a command prompt, execute `dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate`
1. Execute `dotnet ef database update`
1. Use the *SQL Server Object Explorer* in Visual Studio (available in the 
'view' menu if it's not already open) to inspect the newly created database's 
schema
  1. If you like, you can create a query to see the database contents, but 
  there won't be any data yet
1. Launch the app and you will be able to see the data (both seeded and 
changed through the APIs we've written) reflected in the database
1. These steps can be repeated if your models change to update an existing 
database (by adding a migration) without having to re-create the database 
from scratch
