# Workshop Lab Snippets
This folder contains text files with the code snippets used in each of the 
workshop labs. Most of these code snippets can be found in the lab markdown 
files directly, but are provided in these text files as a convenient source 
for copy/pasting from if you are following along with the labs but don't want 
to type out all the added code.

Note that most snippets do not include associated `using` statements, so those 
will need to be added manually. They can usually be added in Visual Studio (or 
Visual Studio Code) by pressing `<crtrl>-.` to access 'quick options' which 
will include options to add necessary `using` statements to the top of the 
file.
