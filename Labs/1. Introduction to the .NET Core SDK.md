# Introduction to the .NET Core SDK

## Install the .NET Core SDK
1. Go to https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core and follow the 
instructions to download and install the .NET Core SDK for your OS

## Create and run your first application
1. Open a command prompt
1. Type dotnet --version and ensure on 2.0
1. Make a new directory to put your application in and change to it

   ```
   mkdir MyNewApp
   cd MyNewApp
   ```
1. Create a new application by typing `dotnet new console`
1. Restore the application's dependencies by typing `dotnet restore`
1. Run the application by typing `dotnet run`
1. Open the `Program.cs` file and change the greeting message
1. Run the application again using `dotnet run` and note the message about 
the application being re-built

## Run the project output directly
1. `dotnet run` checks the project source every time to determine if a 
re-build is necessary and as such is intended for active development 
scenarios.
1. Run the project output directly by typing `dotnet 
./bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0/MyNewApp.dll`
1. Change the greeting in `Program.cs` again and run the application output 
directly once more, note that the greeting doesn't change as you didn't 
re-build the project.
1. Build the project by typing `dotnet build`
1. Run the project output directly again and see the greeting has now changed

## Explore the project files
1. Open the `MyNewApp.csproj` file in Visual Studio and explore its contents 
and try using IntelliSense to change some project configuration values
1. Look at the files and directories created when the project is built

## Run from Visual Studio
1. Press *F5* to launch the application from Visual Studio
1. Set a break point and notice debugging options when it's hit

## Check Out ASP.NET Core Templates in Visual Studio
1. Close the current solution in Visual Studio
1. Create a new project and notice the same .NET Core templates that were 
available from the .NET CLI are available in Visual Studio
